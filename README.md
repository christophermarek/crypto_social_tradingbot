Project Proposal:

The problem with data analytics for the stock market or large cap coins is that retail traders do not impact the price as much as low cap cryptocurrencies.

- If you can track analytics on lower cap coins


Plan:
-> would I have to track realtime?
-> I already have my server running for that so I can just add it
