Project Proposal:

The problem with data analytics for the stock market or large cap coins is that retail traders do not impact the price as much as low cap cryptocurrencies.

- If you can track analytics on lower cap coins


Plan:
-> would I have to track realtime?
-> I already have my server running for that so I can just add it
https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2


OK so I forgot how annoying scraping these social media sites are with their rate limiting.

Probably work on the bot first and have a visualizer on the client.
-> with a way the client can modify the bot
-> then I can move onto data sources
